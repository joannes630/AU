    Exercise 1: Calculating Area
    Write a method called `calculateArea` that accepts two parameters: `double width` and `double height`.
    The method should return the area of a rectangle (width * height).

    /*
    Exercise 1_a: Add another method called `calculateAreaCircle` that calculates the area of a circle
    given the radius. Use the formula: area = π * radius².

    Exercise 2: Method Overloading
    Create two overloaded methods called `add`.
    One method should take two integer parameters and return their sum.
    The other method should take three integers and return their sum.

    /*
    Exercise 2_a: Method Overloading
    Add a third overloaded `add` method that takes two double parameters and returns their sum.

    /*
    Exercise 3: Method to Find Maximum of Three Numbers
    Write a Java method named `findMax` that takes three integers as parameters
    and returns the largest number. Call this method from the `main` method and print the result.

    /*
    Exercise 4: Method to Check if a Number is Even
    Write a Java method named `isEven` that takes an integer as a parameter and returns `true` if
    the number is even and `false` otherwise. Call this method from the `main` method and print whether
    a given number is even or odd.
     */

    /*
    Exercise 5: Method to Calculate Factorial
    Write a Java method named `factorial` that takes an integer as an argument
    and returns its factorial. Call this method from the `main` method and print the result.

    /*
    Exercise 5: Temperature Converter
    Problem Description:
    Write a Java program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
    You will create two methods for the conversions.

    Requirements:
    Method 1: convertToFahrenheit(double celsius)
    This method should take a temperature in Celsius as input and return the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.
    Use the formula:
        Fahrenheit = (9/5 * Celsius) + 32

    Method 2: convertToCelsius(double fahrenheit)
    This method should take a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and return the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
    Use the formula:
    Celsius = 5/9 * (Fahrenheit - 32)

    Example:
    If the user inputs 25°C, the output should be 77°F.
    If the user inputs 100°F, the output should be 37.78°C.
