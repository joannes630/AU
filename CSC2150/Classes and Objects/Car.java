/*
Objective:
To practice working with classes, objects, constructors, and methods in Java by creating a basic car rental system.

Assignment Description:

You will create a Java program that simulates a car rental system.
The system will include two classes: Car and CarRental.
For this exercise, just create the Car class.

Requirements:
Class 1: Car

This class represents a car in the rental system.

Attributes:
String make - the make of the car (e.g., Toyota, Ford).
String model - the model of the car (e.g., Camry, Mustang).
boolean isRented - true if the car is currently rented, false otherwise.

Methods:
A constructor to initialize the car with its make and model. The car should not be rented by default.
rentCar() - Marks the car as rented if it's not already rented.
returnCar() - Marks the car as returned.
isAvailable() - Returns true if the car is not rented, false otherwise.
toString() - Returns a string representation of the car in the following format: "Make: [make], Model: [model], Status: [Available/Rented]".
