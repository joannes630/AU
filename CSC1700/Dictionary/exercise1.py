Dictionary
Objective: In addition to adding, updating, and retrieving student grades, 
students will now also calculate the average grade of the class and find the 
student(s) with the highest grade.

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

1. Create an empty dictionary called `grades` to store student names (as keys) 
   and their grades (as values). Make it global.
2. Add new student grades to the dictionary.
3. Retrieve a student's grade by their name.
4. Print all students and their grades.
5. Calculate and print the average grade.
6. Find and print the student(s) with the highest grade.

Instructions:
1. Create an empty dictionary (global) called grades.
2. Implement the following functions:
	a. add_grade(student, grade): Adds or updates a studentâ€™s grade.
	b. get_grade(student): Retrieves the grade for a specific student.
	c. print_grades(): Prints all students and their grades.
	d. calculate_average(): Calculates and prints the average grade.
	e. get_highest_grade(): Finds and prints the student(s) with the highest 
	   grade.
