# These programs illustrate running total

# Compute the total of the numbers from 1 to 10
# total = 0
# x = 1
# while x <= 10:
#     total += x
#     x += 1
# print(total)

# Compute the total of the even numbers only from 1 to 10
# total = 0
# x = 1
# while x <= 10:
#     if x % 2 == 0:
#         total += x
#     x += 1
# print(total)
