# Chained decision is another way to implement
# range checking, without using logical operator

# age = 21
# Check if a person is between 10 and 20 years old
# if age >= 10 and age <= 20:
#     print("In range")
# else:
#     print("Out of range")

# Using chained decision
# if 10 <= age <= 20:
#     print("In range")
# else:
#     print("Out of range")

# Another example
# temp = 80
# Check if temperature is within comfortable room range (68â€“75 F)
# if temp >= 68 and temp <= 75:
#     print("Comfortable")
# else:
#     print("Uncomfortable")

# Using chained decision
# if 68 <= temp <= 75:
#     print("Comfortable")
# else:
#     print("Uncomfortable")
